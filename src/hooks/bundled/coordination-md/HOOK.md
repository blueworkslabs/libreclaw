# COORDINATION.md Hook

Loads `COORDINATION.md` from the agent workspace into Project Context during `agent:bootstrap`.

## Why

LibreClaw deployments use `COORDINATION.md` as shared multi-agent coordination context. OpenClaw's bundled `bootstrap-extra-files` hook intentionally only permits the standard bootstrap filenames, so this hook provides a narrow, explicit loader for this one file.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "coordination-md": {
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Behavior

- Resolves `COORDINATION.md` relative to the agent workspace.
- Keeps reads inside the workspace root.
- Skips silently if the file is absent.
- Deduplicates if another hook already injected the same file.
